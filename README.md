Smart Car Parking System | Embedded Systems Project
As part of my academic and practical experience in embedded systems, I developed a Smart Car Parking System using Arduino, IR sensors, LCD, and servo motors. This system is designed to efficiently manage car entry and exit in real-time, automatically detecting vehicle presence and displaying available parking slots.

Key Features:

Automatic Gate Control using servo motors and IR sensors.

Real-Time Slot Monitoring to display available and occupied spots.

Compact Hardware Design optimized for low-cost implementation.

User-Friendly Interface for easy parking management.

Technologies Used:
Arduino Uno, IR Sensors, Servo Motors, LCD, Breadboard Wiring, C++ (Arduino IDE)
